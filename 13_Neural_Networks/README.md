## Overview

Neural networks are a fundamental building block of modern deep learning. This chapter covers the mathematical foundations, architecture design, training algorithms, and practical implementations needed to build and train neural networks effectively.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you should understand:

- The biological inspiration behind artificial neural networks
- The mathematics of forward and backward propagation
- Activation functions and their roles in neural networks
- Training optimization techniques (SGD, Adam, RMSprop)
- How to implement neural networks from scratch
- When and how to use PyTorch and TensorFlow
- Hyperparameter tuning and regularization techniques
