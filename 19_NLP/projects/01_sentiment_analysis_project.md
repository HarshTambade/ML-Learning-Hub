# Project 1: Movie Review Sentiment Analysis

## Overview
Build a complete sentiment analysis system for movie reviews using ML and DL approaches.

## Dataset: IMDB 50K Reviews
- 50,000 reviews (25K train, 25K test)
- Binary labels: positive/negative

## Steps
1. Load data and explore
2. Preprocess: lowercase, remove special chars, tokenize
3. Feature extraction: TF-IDF, embeddings, BERT
4. Train models: Naive Bayes, SVM, LSTM, BERT
5. Evaluate: Accuracy, F1, ROC-AUC
6. Deploy: Flask API, Docker

## Expected Accuracy
- Baseline: 50%
- TF-IDF + SVM: 90%
- LSTM: 94%
- BERT: 97%

## Libraries
- pandas, scikit-learn, nltk, pytorch, transformers

## Time: 25-30 hours

## Deliverables
- Python notebook with full pipeline
- Trained model artifacts
- API endpoint for predictions
- Performance report with visualizations
