# Exercise 2: ARIMA Modeling

## Problem Statement
Build an ARIMA model for time series forecasting and evaluate its performance.

## Objectives
- Understand ARIMA(p,d,q) parameters
- Determine optimal parameters using ACF/PACF plots
- Fit and evaluate the model
- Make predictions

## Tasks

### Task 1: Parameter Identification
```
- Plot ACF (Auto-Correlation Function)
- Plot PACF (Partial Auto-Correlation Function)
- Identify potential p, d, q values
```

### Task 2: Model Fitting
```
- Fit ARIMA model with selected parameters
- Check model diagnostics
- Analyze residuals for white noise
- Review statistical summary
```

### Task 3: Forecasting
```
- Generate out-of-sample predictions
- Calculate confidence intervals
- Compare multiple forecast horizons (7, 14, 30 days)
```

### Task 4: Model Evaluation
```
- Calculate MAE, RMSE, MAPE
- Compare with baseline models
- Create visualization of forecast vs actual
```

## Data Requirements
- Stationary or differenced time series
- At least 100 observations recommended
- Clear trend or seasonality patterns

## Expected Outcomes
- Understand ARIMA framework
- Ability to select parameters
- Competent in model diagnostics
- Can generate reliable forecasts
