# Exercise 5: Multivariate Time Series Analysis

## Problem Statement
Analyze and forecast multiple correlated time series simultaneously.

## Objectives
- Understand relationships between variables
- Apply multivariate forecasting techniques
- Capture variable dependencies
- Build ensemble models
- Improve prediction accuracy

## Tasks

### Task 1: Data Exploration
```

- Explore correlations
- Identify relationships
- Visualize multiple series
```

### Task 2: Cross-Variable Analysis
```
- Calculate correlation matrix
- Analyze cross-correlations
- Check for Granger causality
- Identify lead-lag relationships
```

### Task 3: Model Selection
```
- Apply Vector Autoregression (VAR)
- Build multioutput regression models
- Compare forecasting approaches
- Select best method
```

### Task 4: Forecasting and Evaluation
```
- Generate multivariate forecasts
- Evaluate on test set
- Compare univariate vs multivariate
- Analyze forecast accuracy improvement
```

## Key Concepts
