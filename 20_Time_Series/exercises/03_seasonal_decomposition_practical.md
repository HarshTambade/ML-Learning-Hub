# Exercise 3: Seasonal Decomposition (Practical)

## Problem Statement
Decompose time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components using practical methods.

## Learning Goals
- Separate different components of time series
- Apply decomposition methods (additive, multiplicative)
- Interpret each component
- Use components for forecasting

## Tasks

### Task 1: Classical Decomposition
```
- Apply additive decomposition
- Apply multiplicative decomposition
- Compare results visually
- Determine which is more appropriate
```

### Task 2: STL Decomposition
```
- Apply STL (Seasonal and Trend using LOESS)
- Analyze trend component smoothing
- Examine seasonal pattern stability
- Check residual quality
```

### Task 3: Component Analysis
```
- Calculate trend strength
- Measure seasonal strength
- Analyze residual noise
- Identify anomalies
```

### Task 4: Practical Application
```
- Reconstruct time series from components
- Create forecasts using decomposed parts
- Compare with original forecast
- Evaluate improvements
```

## Key Concepts
- Additive vs Multiplicative decomposition
- LOESS smoothing technique
- Seasonal index interpretation
- Component-wise forecasting

## Deliverables
- Decomposition plots for both methods
- Component analysis report
- Forecast comparison results
