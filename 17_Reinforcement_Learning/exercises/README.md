## Learning Path

- Start with understanding MDP and Bellman equations
- Implement tabular RL methods first
- Gradually move to function approximation
- Explore policy-based methods
- Combine with deep learning

## Tips

- Visualize agent behavior
- Monitor learning curves
- Test on simple environments first
- Validate with known solutions
