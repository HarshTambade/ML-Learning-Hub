## Getting Started

- Choose a domain that interests you
- Start with simple environments (CartPole, Acrobot)
- Prototype with tabular methods
- Gradually increase problem complexity
- Use deep RL for high-dimensional problems

## Deployment Considerations

- Safety constraints
- Real-time performance
- Sample efficiency
- Transfer to production
- Monitoring and updates
