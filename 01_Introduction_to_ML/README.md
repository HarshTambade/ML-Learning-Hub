# Chapter 01: Introduction to Machine Learning

## 📚 Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will understand:

- **What is Machine Learning?** - Core concepts and definitions
- **Types of Machine Learning** - Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning
- **ML Workflow** - The step-by-step process for building ML models
- **Real-world Applications** - How ML is used across industries

## 🎯 Key Concepts

### What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that enables systems to learn from data and improve their performance on a task without being explicitly programmed. Instead of following pre-defined rules, ML algorithms find patterns in data.

### Types of Machine Learning

#### 1. **Supervised Learning**
- Learn from labeled data (input-output pairs)
- Use cases: Classification, Regression
- Examples: Email spam detection, House price prediction

#### 2. **Unsupervised Learning**
- Learn from unlabeled data
- Find patterns and structure
- Examples: Clustering, Dimensionality reduction

#### 3. **Reinforcement Learning**
- Learn through interaction with environment
- Rewards and penalties guide learning
- Examples: Game AI, Robot control
