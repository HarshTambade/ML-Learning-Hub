## Exercise Files

1. **01_basic_rnn_exercises.md** - Foundational RNN concepts
2. **02_lstm_gru_exercises.md** - LSTM and GRU implementations
3. **03_bidirectional_exercises.md** - Bidirectional RNNs
4. **04_sequence_to_sequence.md** - Seq2Seq models
5. **05_attention_exercises.md** - Attention mechanisms
6. **06_advanced_projects.md** - Complex integration projects

## How to Use These Exercises

1. Start with exercises 01-02 to solidify fundamentals
2. Complete exercises in order as they build on previous concepts
3. Implement exercises locally before checking solutions
4. Refer to code_examples for implementation guidance
5. Read notes for theoretical background

## Difficulty Levels

- **Beginner (01-02)**: Basic RNN concepts, implement from scratch
- **Intermediate (03-04)**: Advanced architectures, real-world applications
- **Advanced (05-06)**: State-of-the-art techniques, optimization

## Getting Started

Begin with `01_basic_rnn_exercises.md` and work through progressively more complex exercises.
